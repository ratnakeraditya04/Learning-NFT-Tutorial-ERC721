# NFT Tutorial

This is a NFT Learning Project where I learnt how to create a NFT token. To learn this, I consulted many resources such as Documentations of Hardhat, Solidity and finally consulted the website <a href = "https://learnweb3.io/courses/9a3fafe4-b5eb-4329-bdef-97b2aa6aacc1/lessons"> LearnWeb3 </a> to learn the fundamentals. 




1. Start a local node. 
```shell 
npx hardhat node 
``` 
2. Open a new terminal and deploy the nft  in the local host network .
```shell
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```

####### Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
After cloning the repository in a new folder, run the following tasks in the teminal :

```shell
npm install 
# npx hardhat help
# npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
